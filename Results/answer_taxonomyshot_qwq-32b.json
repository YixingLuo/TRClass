The reference to \"conform to DC 184\" likely specifies compliance with a standard, but since the core action is data capture (a functional task), the primary classification is **Functional**. The examples provided (e.g., capturing vital signs) align with Functional without additional NonFunctional tags unless explicitly involving processes or constraints (e.g., maintenance).

This is about adhering to procedural or policy-driven steps.\n\n2. **Compare with Examples:** \n   - The first example (\"must comply with the following requirements\") was classified as **Functional** because it mandated an action (providing access).\n   - The second example (\"must be in accordance with paragraphs...\") was classified as **NonFunctional** because it constrained *how* an action (use/disclosure) must be performed.\n\n3. **Determine Classification:** Here, the requirement is framed as an obligation to fulfill specific procedural or policy requirements (d2-d5), which are likely part of regulatory compliance. Since it mandates an action (compliance with the sections), it aligns with **Functional** requirements (what the entity must do). The specifics of d2-d5 (e.g., security, privacy) might involve NonFunctional aspects, but the requirement itself is about performing the action of compliance, making **Functional** the primary classification.\n\n4. **Final Decision:** The requirement emphasizes the *need to comply with specified sections*, which is a Functional requirement."}]}]}
